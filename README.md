# VBSnippets

This repository contains a collection of VB.NET code that I have written over the years while learning the language. All of the source code in this repository is free to use and modify for any purpose.

Please note that some of the code may be outdated and may not be the best way to perform certain tasks. Use at your own risk and feel free to improve upon the code.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please open an issue or pull request.

Enjoy!
